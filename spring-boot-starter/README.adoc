## Resources for versions older than 2.3.0

Before version 2.2.0, the project existed as a community extension. Therefore the resources were located in different paths. You can find all the links below.

#### Migration hints from < 1.3.0 to >= 1.3.0

[IMPORTANT]
We have decided to refactor the configuration mechanism. Especially, we removed the  `io.orqueio.bpm.spring.boot.starter.configuration.OrqueioConfiguration` interface. For now, each configuration is a `io.orqueio.bpm.engine.impl.cfg.ProcessEnginePlugin`. With this it is possible to hook into `preInit`, `postInit` and `postProcessEngineBuild`, which supports more complex situations.
If you have implemented a `OrqueioConfiguration`, you have to switch to `ProcessEnginePlugin` (and its `preInit` method). You can also extend your configuration from `io.orqueio.bpm.spring.boot.starter.configuration.impl.AbstractOrqueioConfiguration` to avoid a cast to `SpringProcessEngineConfiguration`.

### 1.2.1
